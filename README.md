# Soundanoid
Sound + Arkanoid

Soundanoid was a side project, the idea was joining the famous game Arkanoid with Music mechanics.
Each block that the player destroys plays a specific sound, by playing the game the player is actually 
making a music. Soundanoid is being programmed strictly from 0, without using any game engines.

This project is currently on hold and hasn't been updated in a while.
